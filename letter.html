    <h1>💌 My Dearest Love 💌</h1>
    <p>
      From the moment we met, my life has been brighter, warmer, and filled with laughter.  
      Every memory with you is a treasure I keep close to my heart.  
      You are my safe place, my biggest adventure, and my sweetest dream.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grateful for every silly joke, every late-night talk, and every smile we’ve shared.  
      I promise to cherish you, support you, and love you endlessly.  
      You are my forever. 💖
    </p>
    <p class="signature">
      With all my love,<br>
      <strong>— Yours Always 💕</strong>
